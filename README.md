<img src="./screenshots/screenshot.png" alt="App Screenshots">

> Rental search app (ApartmentSearch)
>
> A project that offers a practical introduction to Angularâ€™s Modular Architecture, focusing on Smart and Dumb Components (Container & Presentational Components for better separation of concerns) and the creation of a custom Reactive State Management system built on RxJS.

> Built using Angular CLI 16.2.1 & Json-server.

## Purpose
The goal of this project is to build an Angular application while learning how to design it in a way that ensures sustainable development speed and facilitates the easy addition of new features in the long run
This application present high-level recommendations for a well-designed Angular application architecture based on best practices and battle-tested patterns.

- Project structure and settings.
- Modular design.
- Proper abstractions between application layers.
- Smart and Dumb components pattern.
- Unidirectional data flow.
- Reactive state management (using own RxJS store).

## Implementation 

This application provides a comprehensive learning experience by incorporating advanced Angular techniques and best practices.

ðŸ”¹ **State Management with RxJS**: Understand how to use RxJS to create own state management.

ðŸ”¹ **Preloading Configuration Files**: Learn how to dynamically load a configuration file before the app initializes, enabling flexible settings management without modifying the code.

ðŸ”¹ **Custom SVG Icon Integration**: Implement a system for registering and using custom SVG icons within the application to enhance UI design and maintain scalability.

ðŸ”¹ **Internationalization (i18n) with @ngx-translate/core**: Explore how to implement multilingual support efficiently using a third-party library, making the app accessible to users in different languages.

ðŸ”¹ **Infinite Scrolling for Enhanced User Experience**: Learn to integrate infinite scrolling in a listing view, allowing users to load more data seamlessly as they scroll, improving performance and usability.

ðŸ”¹ **Global Error Handling**: Implement a centralized error-handling mechanism to catch and manage errors globally, ensuring a robust and user-friendly web application.

ðŸ”¹ **Dynamic Page Titles with Angular Router**: Set page titles dynamically using Angular Router.


## UI Features

- **Apartment Search Page**: browse available apartments.
- **Detailed Apartment Overview**: view comprehensive details about each apartment.
- **Multilingual Support**: the app supports internationalization in three languages, ensuring accessibility for a diverse audience.
- **Advanced Filtering:**: users can refine their search by city and borough, making it easier to find the perfect apartment. Additionally, more listings can be loaded dynamically via scrolling.
- **Favorites Management:** a dedicated favorites page allows users to quickly view and manage their saved apartments.
- **Favorites & Storage Sync**: save preferred apartments to a favorites list, which automatically syncs with local storage for easy access across sessions.
